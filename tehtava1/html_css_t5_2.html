        <h1>Graphics</h1>
        <p>The Web is about more than text and information, it is also a medium for expressing artistic creativity, data visualization, and optimizing the presentation of information for different audiences with different needs and expectations. The use of graphics on Web sites enhances the experience for users, and W3C has several different and complementary technologies that work together with HTML and scripting to provide the creators of Web pages and Web Applications with the tools they need to deliver the best possible representation of their content. Learn more below about:</p>
        <p>This intro text is boilerplate for the beta release of w3.org. Our intent is to invite the community to develop this template and help provide useful content and links. For a more complete example, see the page for HTML & CSS.chnology that enables people to use fonts on demand over the Web without requiring installation in the operating system. W3C has experience in downloadable fonts through HTML, CSS2, and SVG. Until recently, downloadable fonts have not been common on the Web due to the lack of an interoperable font format. The WebFonts effort plans to address that through the creation of an industry-supported, open font format for the Web (called "WOFF").</p>
